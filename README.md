## Topics for 2025 Problem Sets  

I will be doing problems on the following topics in 2025:  

- **Real and Complex Analysis** 
- **Database Management Systems (mainly normal forms, hashing and indices)**  
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**  
- **Discrete Mathematics**  
- **Linear Algebra**  
- **Abstract Algebra**  
- **Combinatorial Game Theory**

Huge thanks to A Mathematical Room for reviewing my solutions without asking anything for it.
